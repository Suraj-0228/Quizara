## 2. Proposed System

### 2.1 Objectives
The primary objective of the QuizMaster platform is to modernize and streamline the process of knowledge assessment. In an educational landscape increasingly reliant on digital tools, having an intuitive and reliable testing platform is critical. QuizMaster aims to provide a visually engaging interface that encourages participation and reduces test anxiety. By moving away from paper-based or archaic digital testing systems, the platform seeks to create a dynamic environment that resonates with modern learners, thereby improving completion rates and assessment accuracy.

A key operational objective is to simplify the complex processes involved in quiz creation and result management. For administrators and educators, the platform is designed to be a powerful tool that simplifies daily tasks such as drafting multiple-choice questions, organizing content into specific categories, and grading attempts. By automating the scoring and organizing these workflows, QuizMaster aims to reduce manual grading errors, save educators immense amounts of time, and allow them to operate more efficiently.

Enhancing user engagement and providing immediate value are central to the platform's user-centric goals. QuizMaster strives to create a rewarding user journey, from the moment a student logs in to the instant they complete a quiz. This involves implementing clear progress indicators, immediate automated scoring on submission, and tangible rewards for success. By minimizing friction and offering immediate feedback, including downloadable PDF certificates for passing scores, the system encourages continued learning and improves overall user satisfaction.

Ensuring reliability and data integrity is a fundamental architectural objective. As an assessment tool, its software infrastructure must be able to securely handle concurrent test-takers without losing data or crashing. QuizMaster is engineered to be robust, utilizing the proven stability of Apache/Nginx web servers and relational MySQL databases. The goal is to provide a platform that institutions can trust to accurately record and maintain student performance histories over time.

Another significant objective is to ensure the security and privacy of student data. With the increasing requirements of educational privacy laws, building trust with users is essential. QuizMaster aims to implement rigorous security protocols, including secure password hashing and token-based account recovery mechanisms. The objective is to safeguard sensitive student information, ensuring a secure environment for examination.

Lastly, the project aims to provide a data-driven foundation for educational decision-making. By capturing detailed information on quiz attempts, question accuracy, and overall scores, the system creates a valuable repository of performance data. The objective is to empower educators with insights that help them understand student comprehension, identify difficult topics, and tailor their teaching strategies for better educational outcomes.

### 2.3 Scope
The scope of QuizMaster encompasses a comprehensive Assessment Discovery module designed to facilitate an effortless learning experience. This includes a dynamic, paginated quiz catalog that allows students to browse through available tests with descriptions and metadata. The system supports category filtering and keyword search capabilities, enabling students to quickly find quizzes relevant to their current studies or interests, ensuring that the question bank is easily accessible and navigable.

User Management is another critical component within current scope. The system provides a secure and user-friendly registration and login process, featuring backend email validation and strong password hashing. Once authenticated, users have access to a personalized dashboard where they can manage their profiles, update security settings, and view their accumulated experience points (XP). The scope also includes a robust, secure "Forgot Password" flow utilizing 15-minute expiring tokens sent via email (PHPMailer integration).

Assessment Processing forms the core of the educational functionality. The project scope covers the entire lifecycle of a quiz attempt, starting from an interactive quiz interface that tracks time limits. This workflow collects user answers, processes them immediately upon submission against the database schema, and calculates a final score. Furthermore, the system tracks the complete attempt history for each user, providing them with a visual timeline of their past performances, pass/fail statuses, and the ability to review their detailed correct/incorrect answers.

On the administrative side, the scope includes a powerful Admin Dashboard. This restricted area provides educators with full control over the platform's content and operations. Admins can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Categories, Quizzes, and individual Questions (Multiple Choice, True/False). The dashboard also facilitates Student Management, allowing admins to view registered users, monitor their activities, and manage platform-wide settings.

The security scope involves implementing fundamental measures to protect the platform and its users. This includes the implementation of strict PHP session management for stateful and secure access control, ensuring students cannot access admin routes. Input validation and sanitation on both the client (JS) and server (PHP) sides are included to prevent common web vulnerabilities. Specifically, all database interactions enforce Prepared Statements (PDO) to eradicate SQL injection risks.

Finally, the technical scope defines the boundaries of the platform's operation. QuizMaster is designed as a web-based responsive application accessible via standard web browsers on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It requires a standard web server equipped with PHP and MySQL. The current scope includes advanced reward mechanisms like on-the-fly PDF Certificate generation (via FPDF) for passing scores, and automated SMTP email notifications. It excludes, for this version, native mobile app development or live proctoring features.

## 3. System Design

### 3.1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) serves as a visual representation of how information moves through the QuizMaster system. It maps out the flow of data from external entities, such as the Student and the Administrator, into the system's various processes and data stores. The DFD is crucial for understanding the logical structure of the application, independent of the specific PHP scripts used to implement it. It highlights the transformation of data through processes like registration, quiz submission, and grading.

At the highest level, the Context Diagram (Level 0 DFD) depicts the QuizMaster system as a single process interacting with two main external entities: the Student and the Admin. The Student sends data such as registration details, login credentials, and quiz answers into the system, while receiving quiz questions, real-time scores, and PDF certificates in return. The Admin provides inputs for creating quizzes, managing categories, and receiving contact form notifications, receiving student performance reports and system analytics in return.

Drilling down to the Level 1 DFD, the single process is broken down into major sub-processes: Authentication, Content Management, Assessment Engine, and Reporting. The Authentication process handles the verification of user credentials against the Users database table. When a user logs in, their credentials flow into this process, which validates them (via `password_verify`) and initializes a PHP Session. This session data then authorizes subsequent interactions with protected routes. This process also handles the secure email flow for password resets.

The Content Management process is central to the system's operation on the admin side. It receives input from the Admin entity to create Categories and Quizzes. This data is validated and stored in the respective relational tables. Crucially, admins input Questions and Options, which are tied relationally to the Quizzes. On the student side, this process handles search queries and filters for the paginated quiz catalog, retrieving matching data from the database.

The Assessment Engine handles the core educational transaction. When a student starts a quiz, the system retrieves the questions and options. As the student submits their answers, this data flows into the Grading Process. This process compares the submitted answers against the `is_correct` flags in the Options table, calculates the final score, and records the transaction in the `quiz_attempts` and `user_answers` tables. If the score meets the >75% threshold, a trigger allows the Certificate Generation flow to offer a PDF download.

Finally, the system includes a Reporting and Communications flow. Data from the Attempts and Users databases is aggregated to provide the Admin with insights into student performance on their dashboard. Furthermore, automated processes utilize the Email Helper utility to send outgoing SMTP communications (Welcome emails, Score Reports) back to the Student entity, completing the feedback loop and ensuring engagement.

### 3.2 UML Diagram (Class/Entity Relationship Diagram)
In the context of our native PHP API, the UML diagram best translates to an Entity-Relationship (ER) model representing the relational database structure. This blueprint defines the tables, their attributes, and the strict foreign-key relationships between them, ensuring data integrity.

The `users` table is a foundational element, encapsulating all data related to the registered student or administrator. Key attributes include `username`, `email`, `password` (hashed), and `role` (enum: 'admin'/'student'). It also holds the `reset_token` for password recovery. The User entity has a crucial one-to-many relationship with the `quiz_attempts` table, indicating that a single student can take multiple quizzes over time.

The `quizzes` table represents the assessments available. Its attributes include `title`, `description`, `time_limit`, and `passing_score`. This entity has a many-to-one relationship with the `categories` table (each quiz belongs to one category) and a one-to-many relationship with the `questions` table. It is also linked back to the `users` table to track which admin `created_by` it.

The `questions` and `options` tables form a composite structure. A `question` (attributes like `question_text`, `marks`) belongs to one `quiz`. Each `question` has a one-to-many relationship with `options` (attributes like `option_text`, `is_correct` boolean). This structure accurately models multiple-choice and true/false formats, keeping the correct answer abstracted from the student interface until grading.

The `quiz_attempts` table is complex, acting as the transactional connector between students and quizzes. It contains attributes like final `score`, `total_questions`, `started_at`, and `completed_at`. Crucially, it has a one-to-many relationship with `user_answers`, which links a specific attempt to the exact `selected_option_id` for every `question_id`. This granular level of tracking ensures educators can review precisely where a student succeeded or failed.

Finally, utility tables like `settings` (key-value pairs for global configuration) and `contact_messages` (storing incoming support requests) exist independently, facilitating site-wide management operations outside the core assessment flow.

## 4. System Testing

### 4.1 Frontend (Client-Side) Validation
Frontend validation provides immediate visual feedback to the user, ensuring a smooth experience before data even hits the PHP server. In QuizMaster, this is implemented using Vanilla JavaScript integrated deeply with Bootstrap 5's validation classes (`was-validated`). 

When a user attempts to submit a form (e.g., Registration), the JavaScript intercepts the event. It checks for **Required Fields**, ensuring no empty data is sent. It also enforces format rules; for instance, **Email Validation** uses regex to ensure the input resembles `user@domain.com`. Furthermore, the registration script includes **Cross-Field Validation** to ensure the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields are identical before allowing the form to proceed. This fail-fast approach prevents frustrating server-reload errors for simple typos.

### 4.2 Backend (Server-Side) Validation
Backend Validation is the critical security gatekeeper. Because frontend JS can be bypassed, PHP must rigorously re-validate every incoming `$_POST` and `$_GET` request. 

QuizMaster utilizes a central `sanitize()` function (found in `includes/functions.php`) to strip HTML tags and prevent XSS attacks across all text inputs. Furthermore, the database interactions rely exclusively on **PDO Prepared Statements**. Whether an admin is defining a quiz title, or a student is submitting an answer option, the data is bound as a parameter rather than concatenated into the SQL string. This completely neutralizes SQL Injection threats.

Additionally, the backend enforces **Logical Validation**. For example, the `take-quiz-process.php` script verifies that a submitted `option_id` actually belongs to the correct `question_id` in the database, preventing malicious users from tampering with hidden form fields to score unearned points.

### 4.3 Authentication & Authorization Validation
Security in QuizMaster is managed through session-based authentication. When a user logs in, their password is securely validated against the bcrypt-hashed string in the database using PHP's `password_verify()` function. Upon success, a secure `$_SESSION['user_id']` and `$_SESSION['role']` are established.

Authorization is enforced via strict, included middleware functions like `requireLogin()` and `requireAdmin()`. Placed at the very top of sensitive scripts, these functions check the session state. If a student attempts to load `admin/dashboard.php`, the `requireAdmin()` function immediately halts execution and redirects them, ensuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is tightly enforced.

The secure **Password Reset flow** utilizes unique, cryptographically secure random bytes (`bin2hex(random_bytes(32))`) to generate tokens. These tokens are saved to the database alongside a strict 15-minute MySQL timestamp expiration (`DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 15 MINUTE)`). This ensures recovery links delivered via email are single-use and highly secure against interception.

### 4.4 Manual Testing
Manual testing verifies the end-to-end functionality. Below is a summary of the executed test cases confirming the core features are stable and reliable for production use.

| Test Case ID | Test Description | Expected Result | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| TC-01 | User Registration | User created in DB; Welcome Email dispatched via PHPMailer | Pass |
| TC-02 | User Login (Student) | Session started, redirected to Student Dashboard | Pass |
| TC-03 | Search & Filter Quizzes | Pagination and GET parameters correctly filter SQL query results | Pass |
| TC-04 | Complete Quiz (Pass) | Score calculated, DB updated, Confetti UI shown, PDF Cert available | Pass |
| TC-05 | Admin Unauthorized Access | Non-admin user redirected from `/admin/` routes | Pass |
| TC-06 | Forgot Password Flow | Token generated, Email sent, user can reset within 15 mins | Pass |
| TC-07 | Generate PDF Certificate | Valid FPDF document generated with accurate user data and dark theme | Pass |

## 5. Future Enhancement

### 5.1 Enhanced User Interactions
Future iterations of QuizMaster will focus on adding more engaging testing formats. A primary feature planned is **Fill-in-the-Blanks / Short Answer questions**. This requires complex backend string-matching algorithms (potentially utilizing Levenshtein distance for minor spelling errors) to grade text rather than just distinct multiple-choice IDs.

We also plan to implement a **Live Leaderboard System**. By gamifying the experience further, tracking total XP, badges earned, and top scores across the entire platform, we can create a competitive environment that encourages repeated engagement and learning.

### 5.2 Advanced Context Management
Advanced Context Management involves utilizing data to improve the educational value of the platform. We plan to integrate **Detailed Assessment Analytics**. For the educator, the dashboard will visualize not just overall scores, but question-by-question breakdown charts. This data-driven insight will allow teachers to identify "problem questions" where a majority of students failed, indicating a topic that needs to be retaught.

### 5.3 Improved User Experience
Improving the User Experience (UX) is an ongoing process. A critical next step is the addition of an active, **On-Screen Real-Time Timer** during quizzes. While the backend currently enforces time limits, adding a visual countdown clock via Javascript (syncing periodically with the server) that auto-submits the form when time runs out will add a necessary sense of urgency and realism to examination conditions.

Additionally, we aim to allow **Profile Customization**. Allowing users to upload custom profile avatars (handling secure file uploads and MIME type validation in PHP) will break away from default UI components and allow users greater expression on the platform.

## 6. Bibliography

### 6.1 Limitations
Despite the robustness of the current QuizMaster system, there are technical limitations in this native architecture. The most significant is the lack of a **Front-Controller / MVC Framework**. Because it relies on direct page scripts (e.g., `results.php`), scaling the application to hundreds of distinct views will result in repeated code and harder routing management compared to using a framework like Laravel.

**Session Scalability** is another limitation. Native PHP sessions write to temporary files on the server's hard drive. If deployed to a load-balanced, multi-server environment (AWS, etc.), sessions will fail unless reconfigured to store data in a centralized memory cache like Redis or Memcached.

Finally, while the **Email Integration** using PHPMailer is functional and excellent for MVP environments, it is currently "synchronous". When a user completes a quiz, they must wait for the SMTP server to send the email before the results page loads. In a heavy production environment, this should be offloaded to an asynchronous background worker queue (e.g., Beanstalkd, RabbitMQ) to guarantee instantaneous page loads.

### 6.2 Conclusion
QuizMaster successfully demonstrates the power and flexibility of a modern, data-driven PHP assessment architecture. By heavily upgrading the standard LAMP stack with real-world features like SMTP Email integrations, secure token cryptography, and on-the-fly PDF Generation (FPDF), the project delivers an exceptional, interactive user experience that meets the high standards of modern EdTech.

The project highlights the effectiveness of robust server-side processing combined with modern frontend aesthetics. The seamless integration of Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS allows for a bespoke Glassmorphism design that breaks the mold of traditional, boring testing software. The user interface is an active participant in the educational process, guiding users intuitively and rewarding them visually.

From a learning perspective, this project serves as a masterclass in secure Full-Stack Development. It tackles critical, real-world development challenges: defending against SQL injection via PDO, handling accurate timezone mathematics for expiring tokens, migrating client-side search logic to dynamic server-side SQL pagination, and marrying complex libraries (PHPMailer, FPDF) into native scripts without relying on heavier frameworks like Composer auto-loading.

In conclusion, QuizMaster is an advanced, deployment-ready prototype. It successfully meets its primary objectives of modernizing assessment, streamlining operations, and providing a secure, engaging environment. It stands as a testament to the enduring capabilities of PHP when applied thoughtfully and offers a robust, highly-impressive portfolio piece for modern web development.
